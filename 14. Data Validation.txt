Attribute check:

Randomly check few records to see if the correct values are populated in the various columns.
In Redshift, verify the columns derived from dimension tables (customer / seller) are populated correctly.
Verify the correct timestamp is populated in dwh_create_timestamp column.
The difference between dwh_create_timestamp and order_purchase_timestamp is teh time taken to process a record from FO to the datawarehouse.

Athena:
SELECT * FROM "ecommerce-database"."vinod_streaming_project_staging_bucket";

Redshift:
select * from ecommerce.orders;

-----------------------------------------

Count check:

The count in S3 Staging area must be equal to the count in Redshift final table:

Athena:
SELECT count(*) FROM "ecommerce-database"."vinod_streaming_project_staging_bucket";

Redshift:
select count(*) from ecommerce.orders;

-------------------------------------

Duplicate check:

Duplicate records must not exist in both S3 staging area as well as Redshift.
Below queries must not return any data:

Athena:
select order_id, product_code, count(*) from "ecommerce-database"."vinod_streaming_project_staging_bucket"
group by order_id, product_code
having count(*) > 1;

Redshift:
select order_id, product_code, count(*) from ecommerce.orders
group by order_id, product_code
having count(*) > 1
