I tried to run the command "aws --version" from my command prompt (C:\Users\Vinod)
I was getting the error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘awscli’".

Upon running the command:
python -m pip install awscli

I was able to run the command "aws --version" successfully.
I also tried running aws s3 ls and it listed down all my buckets.

If aws s3 ls command does not work or it shows the buckets ina different region, we might have to configure the user by running the command:
aws configure
You will need the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key (from IAM -> Users) for this.

Once verified in command prompt, Open terminal in Visual Studio Code editor and try out the same.
