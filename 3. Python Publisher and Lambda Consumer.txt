Refer "Code" folder for the order generator and order publisher code.
Order publisher code makes use of the order generator code to publish data into the kinesis data stream.
There are 3 different flavors of the order publisher code -> 
publish each record into the stream, publish each record with guaranteed ordering at the shard level and publish a batch of records.

The commands used to invoke the different flavors of order publisher code is also provided.

The lambda consumer code is also present in the "Code" folder.
Same process is used to come up with the lambda consumer code. Print out the event. Loop through the records if needed. In each record, extract individual columns. 
Build an item i.e. a row of columns.
Build an array of items.
Use batch writer to write into DynamoDB.
Each item in DynamoDB will have different number of columns - based on the number of products in each order.
