We execute a copy command that moves all the files from the S3 staging area into Redshift staging area.
Then we call a stored procedure that will perform lookup on dimension tables, enrich the data before loading into the final Redshift table.

We perform a direct insert and no updates / deletes because we want the warehouse to store all information related to every order.
Use the timestamp field to retrieve the latest record of an order if that is what is needed.
